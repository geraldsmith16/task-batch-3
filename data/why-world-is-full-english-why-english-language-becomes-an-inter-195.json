                    "answer": "There was once an arrogant hare who wanted to prove that he was better than everybody else, so he chose the slowest animal in the county, the tortoise, and invited him to a five mile race.The tortoise accepted his challenge and trained hard for the event, while the hare walked around boasting that he was going to humiliate the tortoise and make him look stupid.The day of the race dawned. The tortoise set off at a slow and steady pace, while the hare was dancing around laughing at him; other animals were laughing too, including the rabbit, the badger, and even the little hedgehog.The hare became exhausted from all his dancing around, so he decided to have a nap. When he awoke, he realised that a few hours had passed and the tortoise was nowhere to be seen. The hare panicked and ran the whole course as fast as he could, which was very fast indeed.As he reached the top of the final hill, he could see the finish line in the distance, with the tortoise walking slowly across it, the victor.<br>Narrative text: Generic StructureAs we all know that a narrative should explore problems among the charracters which lead into an interesting plot of the story. This plot determine the narrative story whether it runs smoothly or not. Well, the following note is the generic structure from the story of Hare and Tortoise.<span>Orientation:\u00a0It clearly states that the participants are the hare and the tortoise who live in once time.</span><span>Complication:\u00a0From the second, third, and forth parragraphs, we see that the major complication is set by the arogant hare. In the firs scene, hare and his suppoeters tried to humiliate tortoise while in the same time the tortoise was practicing hard. Because hare thought it was safe, he took a nap, but that was his big mistake.</span><span>Resolution:\u00a0The story of hare and tortoise is closed with the scene of tortoise winning the race. It was a bed and sad ending for hare but it was the victory of tortoise.</span>",

                    "answer": "Giving Instruction 1 - Class Secrets<br>Get the group together and ask for a volunteer to leave the room! Once they\u2019ve gone, think of a \u2018secret\u2019 about that person, for example, it\u2019s their birthday, or they\u2019re having an affair with the college principal. That kind of thing. When they come back in, they have to guess the secret truth about themselves by asking questions. The rest of the group give clues. A great icebreaker, this one always raises a laugh.<br><br>Giving Instruction 2 - Simon Says<br>A party game that works well with English students as a way of practising listening to and understanding commands. The teacher says a number of simple commands, such as, \u2018Put your hands on your head!\u2019, \u2018Stand on one leg!\u2019 or \u2018Start humming!\u2019, and the students have to do what you say \u2013 but only if you have prefaced the command with \u2018Simon says...\u2019. If you don\u2019t say \u2018Simon says...\u2019 and the student follows the command, they are out, and the game resumes until there is a winner.<br><br>Giving Instruction 3 - Party Invitations<br>The whole class sits in a circle! Tell them that it\u2019s your birthday next week and that you\u2019re planning a birthday party. They are all invited... but on one condition. They must bring you a present, and it must be something that you really want. Each student in turn tells you what they will bring to give you on your birthday. You will either tell them that they can come, or that they are not invited. This depends on what they offer to bring you. The item they\u2019re going to bring must begin with the same letter as your first name. If it does, they can come; if it doesn\u2019t, they can\u2019t. For example, if your name is Lucy and they offer to bring \u2018a lemon\u2019 as a present, they will be welcome. If they offer to bring \u2018a bottle of wine\u2019 they will be given short shrift! This game is hilarious, as some students will twig onto your \u2018unspoken rule\u2019 fairly early on, while some won\u2019t get it at all, however obvious you make it!<br><br>Giving Instruction 4 - Something\u2019s Different<br>Get the whole class together! Ask one of them to leave the room, then get the remaining students to change five things about the classroom. For example, you could put a chair on a table, or get two students to swap jumpers, or anything \u2013 so long as it\u2019s not too subtle. Then bring the student back in and get them to guess what changes you have made.<br><br>Giving Instruction 5 - Whispering Trees<br>Get the students standing in a line! Stand at one end and whisper a short phrase or sentence in the ear of the student next to you. For example, you could say, \u2018My dad once met Bernard Cribbins in a bus queue in Dover.\u2019 Each student repeats the phrase to their neighbour until you get to the end of the line, when the last student tells the class the sentence they heard, and you can reveal what the original sentence was. A good game for practising listening and speaking skills.<span><br></span>",
