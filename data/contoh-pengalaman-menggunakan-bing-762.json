            "answer": "\" A Spot Of Pneumonia<br><br>On Christmas Eve I first started feeling short of breath and on Friday the 27th I decided I couldn&#039;t ignore it anymore so I told mum and dad, I need to go to hospital and they willingly obliged.<br><br>On the 27th, they found the there was fluid on the other (the right) side (compared with the left). There wasn&#039;t as much fluid as there was last time so they drained it and I was allowed to go home<br><br>I was meant to be flying up to Waiheke Island and staying in this most stunning house which won house of the year for 2013! We were also meant to be staying with Jannie and Frank who are some of my favorite people in the world.<br><br>I decided that I still wanted to go but flying was out of the question so this time I made the other parent drive me to Auckland so dad obligingly did so. Aren&#039;t I lucky!<br><br>I made it up there but by that evening I wasn&#039;t feeling well and my oral antibiotics just weren&#039;t seeming to work. However we had missed the last ferry and had to wait til the morning and during this time dad put together an idea.<br><br>So the next day we trotted off to see the Waiheke GP and he gave me antibiotics which had to be given twice daily as antibiotics into my bum. About as nice as it sounds.<br><br><span>It actually seemed to work, I felt a bit better and my temp went down but it didn&#039;t last so by the 1st it was apparent I needed to go to the hospital. However I decided I didn&#039;t want to go to Auckland, so both parents did an almighty dash with me in the back in the car to here, Wellington hospital.</span>",
