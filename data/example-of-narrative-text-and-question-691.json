However, I have a request.\u201c said Aji Saka to the \nking. \u201cWhatever you please, young man, I will grant your request,\u201c the \nking replied. \u201cBefore you eat me, grant me some land. Just enough length\n of my own headcloth.\u201c continued Aji Saka. \u201cCome, Young Man. Let&#039;s \nmeasure your headcloth so that I can have my meal and you can have your \nland\u201c agreed the king.<br>\nAjisaka began to unwrap the cloth tied around his head. The king got \ndown from his throne and hold one end of the headcloth. He stepped \nbackward. What he didn&#039;t know was that this headcloth was much longer. \nThe king kept going backward, step by step, as the cloth kept \nunraveling. He stepped backward through the palace square, backward \nacross the village, holding the end of Ajisaka&#039;s headcloth. The king \nkept stepping backward until reached the sea cliftts of the sea.<br>\nA great crowd of people had gathered. They held their breath as their \nking took his final step backward over the cliff&#039;s edge and plunged into\n the waves crashing againts the rocks at the foot of the sea wall.<br>",
