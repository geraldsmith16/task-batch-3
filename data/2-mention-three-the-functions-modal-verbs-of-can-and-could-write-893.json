            "question": "What is the climax of the strory?    True Friends\r\n\r\n Once upon a time, there were two close friends who were walking through the forest together. They knew that anything dangerous can happen any time in the forest. So they promised each other that they would always be together in any case of danger.\r\n\r\n Suddenly, they saw a large bear getting closer toward them. One of them climbed a nearby tree at once. But unfortunately the other one did not know how to climb up the tree. So being led by his common sense, he lay down on the ground breathless and pretended to be a dead man.\r\n\r\n The bear came near the one who was lying on the ground. It smelt in his ears, and slowly left the place because the bears do not want to touch the dead creatures. After that, the friend on the tree came down and asked his friend that was on the ground, \"Friend, what did the bear whisper into your ears?\" The other friend replied, \"Just now the bear advised me not to believe a false friend.\"\r\n\r\n Moral of the Story- A true friend in need is a friend indeed",
