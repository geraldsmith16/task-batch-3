Latihan tidak pernah menjadi hal yang sepele jika kita sedang berusaha untuk lulus ujian. Walau sama-sama bahasa Inggris, tetapi IELTS tetaplah berbeda dibanding soal lainnya.Rekam suara Anda saat latihan tes Speaking. Pada tes asli, suara peserta ujian akan direkam untuk Speaking. Ada baiknya kita lakukan hal serupa, agar kita mampu menganalisa kesalahan yang kita buat, serta latihan untuk memperbaiki kesalahan tersebut.Cari tahu sistem skoring band IELTS. Jika kalian menjelajahi internet, kalian akan menemukan sistem skoring IELTS baik untuk Reading, Listening, Speaking, dan Writing. Ini dapat berguna, karena pada sistem skoring tersebut tertulis secara rinci apa yang dinilai serta apa yang harus dipenuhi untuk mencapai band-band level tertentu.Pelajari pola-pola soal yang ada dalam Reading, Listening, Writing dan Speaking. Setiap kategori memiliki pola yang berbeda, namun jika kalian sering latihan, maka kalian akan menemukan suatu pola dalam tes soal bahasa Inggris IELTS tersebut.Reading: pelajari teknik Scheming dan Scanning.Listening: survey tempat-tempat yang menyediakan ujian IELTS, karena tidak semua tempat yang menyediakan sound yang baik untuk testing IELTS.Writing: Selain mempelajari sistem skoring, writing sudah memiliki struktur yang baku yaitu berisi paragraph Introduction, dua paragraph dengan Main Topik, serta paragraph Conclusion.Speaking: Selain merekam, coba simulasikan dengan teman kalian.Jika ingin lebih pasti lagi, ikuti Preparation IELTS Test Course dimana hal-hal diatas akan diulas dalam kursus tersebut.
