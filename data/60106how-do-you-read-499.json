                    "answer": "<p>Jawaban:</p><p></p><p>Long time ago, in a small village near the beach in West Sumatera, lived a woman and her son, Malin Kundang. Malin Kundang&#039;s father had passed away when he was a baby, and he had to live hard with his mother.</p><p></p><p>Malin Kundang was a healthy, dilligent, and strong child. He usually went to the sea to catch fish, and brought it to his mother, or sold it in the town.</p><p></p><p>One day, when Malin Kundang was sailing as usual, he saw a merchant&#039;s ship which was being raided by a small band of pirates. With his brave and power, Malin Kundang defeated the pirates. The merchant was so happy and asked Malin Kundang to sail with him. Malin Kundang agreed.</p><p></p><p>Many years later, Malin Kundang became a wealthty merchant, with a huge ship, loads of trading goods, many ship crews, and a beautiful wife. In his journey, his ship landed on a beach. The villagers reconigzed him, and the news ran fast in the town: Malin Kundang became a rich man and now he is here. His mother, in deepful sadnees after years of loneliness, ran to the beach to meet her beloved son again.</p><p></p><p>When the mother came, Malin Kundang, in front of his well dressed wife, his crews and his own gloriness, denied to meet that old, poor and dirty woman. For three times she begged Malin Kundang and for three times yelled at him. At last Malin Kundang said to her \"Enough, old woman! I have never had a mother like you, a dirty and ugly peasant!\" Then he ordered his crews to set sail.</p><p></p><p>Enraged, she cursed Malin Kundang that he would turn into a stone if he didn&#039;t apologize. Malin Kundang just laughed and set sail.</p><p></p><p>In the quiet sea, suddenly a thunderstorm came. His huge ship was wrecked and it was too late for Malin Kundang to apologized. He was thrown by the wave out of his ship, fell on a small island, and suddenly turned into stone.</p><p></p><p>Penjelasan: </p><p>hope yoy find this helpful^\u2022^</p><p></p>",
