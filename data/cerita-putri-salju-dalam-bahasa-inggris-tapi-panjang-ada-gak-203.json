            "answer": "A long time ago, a child was born to a queen and king and she was called Snow White.\u00a0 When the queen died, the king married again.\u00a0 This new queen was wicked and hated Snow white.\u00a0 The queen gave orders that Snow White was to be treated as a servant.Snow White grew very beautiful and one day a Prince riding by, saw her at work and fell in love with her.The queen was beautiful too, and every day she asked her Magic Mirror, \"Who is the fairest in the land?\" and the mirror always answered, \"You are the fairest one of all\".But one day the mirror answered Snow White was the fairest in the land, and in a rage the queen gave orders to one of her Huntsmen to take Snow White into the woods and kill her.The Huntsman had a kind heart and couldn&#039;t do the deed so told her to run away.\u00a0 She fled into the woods where Seven little dwarfs lived.\u00a0 Their house was small and strange.\u00a0Snow White entered the little house and finding it very untidy, started to clean up.\u00a0 Upstairs she found seven little beds.\u00a0 She was very tired and stretching out on one of the beds, was soon asleep.When the Dwarfs came home they were surprised to find Snow White and after some argument, decided to let her stay.\u00a0 She promised to cook and look after them.The Queen discovered where Snow White was living and disguising herself as a witch, took a poisoned apple and set out for the Dwarfs cottage.\u00a0 She gave Snow White the poisoned apple to eat and as soon as she bit the apple, she sank into unconsciousness.Thinking she was dead, the Dwarfs built a glass coffin and put her in it. For days she lay in the forest in her glass coffin.\u00a0 One day, the Prince was riding through the forest looking for Snow White and found her.\u00a0 He leaned over and kissed her.\u00a0 She opened her eyes and sat up with a smile. Everyone was happy.\u00a0 The Prince took Snow White to his palace where they were married and lived happily ever after.",
