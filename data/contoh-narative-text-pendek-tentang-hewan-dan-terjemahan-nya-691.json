Venus was very gracious about it, and changed her at once into a beautiful maiden, whom the young man fell in love with at first sight and shortly afterwards married. One day Venus thought she would like to see whether the Cat had changed her habits as well as her form; so she let a mouse run loose in the room where they were. Forgetting everything, the young woman had no sooner seen the mouse than up she jumped and was after it like a shot: at which the goddess was so disgusted that she changed her back again into a Cat.<br><br>Terjemahannya :<br></span>Cerita Venus dan Kucing<br>Suatu ketika,seekor kucing jatuh cinta dengan seorang pemuda tampan, dan memohon dewi Venus untuk mengubah dirinya menjadi seorang wanita. Dewi Venus menerima permintaan tersebut, dan seketika mengubah dirinya menjadi seorang gadis cantik dimana pemuda tersebut langsung jatuh cinta pada pandangan pertama dan tak lama kemudian mereka menikah. Suatu hari dewi Venus berpikir melihat apakah seekor kucing itu telah berubah kebiasaan serta bentuk nya, Maka dewi Venus menizinkan seekor tikus berjalan santai di suatu ruang di mana mereka berada. Seketika itu pula gadis cantik itu melupakan semuanya dan melompat ke arah tikus dengan sangat cepat. Hal ini membuat dewi Venus merasa begitu jijik dan merubahnya kembali menjadi seekor kucing.<br>",

Latihan tidak pernah menjadi hal yang sepele jika kita sedang berusaha untuk lulus ujian. Walau sama-sama bahasa Inggris, tetapi IELTS tetaplah berbeda dibanding soal lainnya.Rekam suara Anda saat latihan tes Speaking. Pada tes asli, suara peserta ujian akan direkam untuk Speaking.
