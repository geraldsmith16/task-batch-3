Dewi Venus menerima permintaan tersebut, dan seketika mengubah dirinya menjadi seorang gadis cantik dimana pemuda tersebut langsung jatuh cinta pada pandangan pertama dan tak lama kemudian mereka menikah. Suatu hari dewi Venus berpikir melihat apakah seekor kucing itu telah berubah kebiasaan serta bentuk nya, Maka dewi Venus menizinkan seekor tikus berjalan santai di suatu ruang di mana mereka berada. Seketika itu pula gadis cantik itu melupakan semuanya dan melompat ke arah tikus dengan sangat cepat. Hal ini membuat dewi Venus merasa begitu jijik dan merubahnya kembali menjadi seekor kucing.<br>",
