And I will tell my hobby that is very interesting for you to try.<br>Handi: Well, I&#039;ll tell you but you must tell your new hobby later. We have a hobby called Jumping Stilts and known as an extreme sport and is currently so popular in Indonesia.<br>Dina: Yes, we join with community of Jumping Stilts Indonesia and practice every week at different places.

It is also an extreme sport that is so famous all over the world.<br>Dina: Let me guess, is it Parkour?<br>Fadli: No, this is a Bungee Jumping.

Can you tell me what places have you visited?<br><span>Fadli: Not many, but I&#039;m very lucky to get a chance to try the beautiful places. I visited Bali in Indonesia. I&#039;ve also been to Colorado, USA. It is the highest bungee jump in the world, positioned in 12th, located not far from the Grand Canyon National Park, USA. Has a 142m just above the Colorado River, right in the historic Navajo Bridge. With stunning wild amazing Grand Canyon make it a popular destination for bungee jumping.</span><br>Dina: Amazing.

You missed the story on Bungee Jumping in Colorado.<br>Ari: I&#039;m stuck in traffic. How are you all? Pleased to meet you. Hi Dina? You&#039;re here too?<br>Dina: Of course, we&#039;re telling some of our new hobby. What about you?<br>Ari: Last week, I climb Semeru, and next week I wanted to Papua.<br>Handi: Climb Jayawijaya?<br>Ari: Of course, you want to come?<br>Fadli: Fantastic, you have a new hobby that is very interesting to try. I want to go with you next week. Incidentally, I want to take time off for a thing, but I decided to go with you.<br>Ari: Is that true? I&#039;m very glad if you could come. I have not talked to you and feel a togetherness as it used to. What about you guys? Handi, Dina, come or not?<br>Dina: I am going to come, and Handi would participate also.<br>Handi: Hey, I have not decided anything.<br>Ari: You have to come Handi, if you have the heart to let Dina walked alone up the Jayawijaya?<br>Handi: Let me join you all.<br>Fadli: This will be an amazing experience. We have never gone together since 6 years ago right?<br>Ari: I agree with you. This will be the best experience we have ever had. Ready to go to Jayawijaya?<br>Fadli, Handi, Dina: Of course.<span><br></span>",
